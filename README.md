# Joy of Coding Solo Internship Project

A solo project will help you apply your knowledge of React or Next.js, along with the tools you've learned (Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and Prisma) and is a great way to transition into client projects on the internship.

We are so excited for you to be on these projects!

We ask that you create a Personal Task Manager Application. This project will help you manage your tasks, and it can serve as an excellent learning experience.

<h2>Project Description:</h2>

_Why:_ 

As a staff we want to see how you approach a problem, how you design a solution, and your flair for implementation. To be able to break down features into code will be vital as a six figure developer.
 
 
_What we are looking for:_
Create a web application that allows users to add, edit, and delete personal tasks. Here are the key features:

- **Task List:** Display a list of tasks, including the task name, description, and due date.
- **Task Creation:** Implement a feature to add new tasks, with fields for task name, description, and due date.
- **Task Editing:** Allow users to edit task details such as the name, description, and due date.
- **Task Deletion:** Enable users to delete tasks they no longer need.
- **Task Organization:** Implement task organization or filtering options, such as sorting by due date or categorizing tasks.
- **User Authentication (optional bonus points):** Add user registration and authentication to allow multiple users to manage their personal tasks.
- **Double Optional:** Build in the following features -- 
   1. An issue summary (chart showing number of issues by type (open, in progress, or closed)
   2. Launch a demo of the app using vercel
   3. Present different user selected color options (and save the options for the next time the user logs in)


_Tech Stack:_

You can choose either React or Next.js as your framework. Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure a clean and modern interface. For user interface components, leverage Radix UI for accessibility and a polished look. Set up a mySql or Postgres database, using Prisma like you learned in the last Mosh tutorial. Prisma will come in handy for managing the database and storing task data.

This project will give you an opportunity to apply your knowledge and encourage you to explore new concepts such as user authentication, state management, and more. It's a practical way to create something useful while continuing to expand your web development skills. Happy coding, and have fun building your Personal Task Manager!


# Dear Diary: A Django-blog
An example of my experience setting up a web application using Django. In this case, I opted to go with a blog as it has several components, including: articles (which can be written by any user once logged in), user sign up, user authentication, and protected pages.

### Technologies Used
Django

### Requirements
Dear Diary requires Python (or Python 3 for Mac). To download, please follow this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Run the Program
To run the Dear Diary program on your local device:
1. Clone the github repo to your IDE (I personally use VSCode)
2. In the terminal, run `python manage.py runserver`
This should open up the application, likely on port 127.0.0.1:8000, unless this port is already in use

### Usage Instructions
Once you have the applicaiton running on your local device, signup up for an account.
After your account is created, you will be able to add articles for everyone to read (please only post appropraite content)
